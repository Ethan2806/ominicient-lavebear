## Goals for CSP This Year:

Hi! My name is Liav, here are my goals for CSP this year! 

- I would like understand the fundamentals of coding 
- I want to understand how websites are developed and how coders around the world make them
- I also want to understand the various projects that are completed within CSP and how they will enrich my coding abilities.

I am very excited to get better at coding and am looking forward for this new year!

## hacks for Bash (Hacks #3) 

- We use the code "--version" to verify that we installed a tool, while clarifying what version is currently installed.
- We can verify the packages and versions that have been installed with Anaconda with "conda list"  
- You can update a repository by committing your changes and pushing the same. Using "git add" to add desired files, "git commit" to commit the changes to your repository, and "git push" to push the changes that you have committed to your repository.
- We are able to automate an action by programming a script to complete the desired task.
