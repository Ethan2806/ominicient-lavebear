# 1.3 Video Notes

## Video 1.3.1: 
- Computer programs are developed with a systematic approach to meet design elements.
    - starts with an idea
    - follow specific steps and stick to a plan
- Dev Process can be orderd and intentional or exploratory. 
Phases of the dev process include:
    - investigating/reflecting
    - designing
    - prototyping
    - testing
- Developers must determine the program requirements and constraints
- revisiting earleier phases of the process allows refinemnt and revision based on feedback and testing
- Break down your problem/coding process into numerous pieces and make sure each piece works before combining the program as a whole.
- investigation is usefull to identify the program constraints and concerns for the user.
    - Collecting data with survey
    - user testing
    - interviews
    - Direct Observations 
- Program requirements describe user interactions and program functions 
    - include user interactions and create an outline of them
- Design phase of development outlines how they will accomplish a given program goal/specification
    - brainstorming
    - planning and storyboarding
    - organizing the program into modules and functional components
    - creation of diagrams that represent the layouts of the user interface
    - dev of a testing strategy for the program.
