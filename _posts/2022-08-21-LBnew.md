## Goals for CSP This Year:

Hi! My name is Liav, here are my goals for CSP this year! 

- I would like understand the fundamentals of coding 
- I want to understand how websites are developed and how coders around the world make them
- I also want to understand the various projects that are completed within CSP and how they will enrich my coding abilities.

I am very excited to get better at coding and am looking forward for this new year!
