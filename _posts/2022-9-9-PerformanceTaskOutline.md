# General Idea
## NFL Fantasy Football Team Generator
- Start with a home page that welcomes the user to the Fantasy Team Generator and have a button "Click Start to Begin"
- First page will ask what colors they like (List colors that are predominant colors of specific NFL Teams such as Red Chiefs, Black Raiders, Green Packers, Purple Ravens, Blue Titans, Orange Bengals, etc) The color they choose will be assiciated with their base team.
- Every page after this will Display 4 traits of QB, RB, Tight End, WR, CB, S, DL, LB, and one player will be associated with each of the traits. For example for QB the traits will be Scrambler (Russel Wilson), Dual Threat (Lamar Jackson), Gunslinger (Patrick Mahomes), Pocket Passer (Tom Brady). The trait they choose is the player at that position that will be on their fantasy team.
- The last page will display the total fantasy team that they have created. With Images of all the players and the logo of the NFL team that they got.
