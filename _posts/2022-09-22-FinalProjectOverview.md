# Our Final Project: Interactive Journal
- Our Project will be an interactive journal that the user will use to track their gratitude, and moods.
- The user will journal their daily gratitude and activities, while selecting from various emoticons that select your mood.
- The output/purpose of the program is to improve the mental health of its user and to track their moods. This program will improve its users mental health, because it allows them to document what they are grateful for and understand the positive side of their life.

# AP Exam Requirements: 

## #1: Program Purpose and Function
- The purpose of the program is to provide a platform in which users can schedule and plan out their day, as well as take into account their mindfulness and mental health.

## #2: Data Abstraction
- We will store ratings and scales for the users moods and characteristics in lists. This data is what will be used in our program, thus demonstrating data abstraction.

## #3: Managing Complexity
- The program we will be creating will contain a list of all the moods, journals, and feeling categories that are essential to contain in out code segment, therefore the program could not be written without it.

## #4: Procedral Abstraction 
- The proceedure that the user will endure will include selecting their mood from a variety of emoticons. The parameter that will limit this procedure include the list of Moods and feelings that are accountable for the output of the program. 

## #5: Algorithm Implementation
- Our program will involve a sequence of various mood/feeling options, that will be selected by the user. The selection of the various given options will determine the path that the program will take (depending on the user). The iteration will then be a repition of a section of code that gives the user their options.

## #6: Testing
- Eventually, our program will contain an "overview of your week" feature that will require the abstraction of code segments that were utilized and run throughout the week in order to display to the user a log of the journal they created over the course of the past week.
