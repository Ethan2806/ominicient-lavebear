# Hacks 
- We could have many syntax errors, becuse most of my group is not expirienced with coding in any language.
- After we manage to create the code for the journal we will do test runs of every mood, category and journal type.
- If we do expirience any bugs, we will converse as a group, discuss with classmates, search up on google, or ask the teacher for assistance to fix it.
- We will rerun the code evertime we add something to ensure that it works.
- Our steps to testing will be 1: Code the interface, 2: code the journal, and 3: code the lists, making sure to test and document evertime.
